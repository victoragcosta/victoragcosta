### Hi, I'm Victor

#### 🎓 I'm currently a computer engineering student at Universidade de Brasília

It's my last semester there and it has been a really good journey until now. Learned a lot about programming, computers and some soft skills that are useful as a developer.
There I learned a bit about:

- 💻 imperative, object oriented, logical and functional languages
- 📱 mobile development
- 🌎 web development
- 🤖 machine learning and AI
- 💻➡💻 networking
- 📱💨 embedded systems
- ⚡ eletrical and electronic circuits
- 👨‍💼 project management
- ⏳ agile development
- 🤷‍🖥 computer-person interaction (useful for UX)

#### 📱 Currently working as a mobile developer intern at VLG Investimentos

Happy to learn about mobile development using Svelte Native with a complex app.

#### 🚗 Creating a way to visualize a recreation of an accident based on a car blackbox

Some students at my university created a cheap blackbox for cars with hobbyist components. With the data collected from it, others students interpreted, filtered and improved the data generated by the blackbox. Now it's my turn to get this data and show in a 3D environment built with Unity so investigators can get a better understanding of what happened.

#### 🙌 Interests/Hobbies

- 🎮 Game development
- 📱💨 Embedded systems and IoT
- 🤖 Inteligent agents with machine learning in Unity
